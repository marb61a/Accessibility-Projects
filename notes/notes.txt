Intro to Web Accessibility
    - Accessibility is often abbreviated to A11y, or Ally
    - The 11 in the middle represents the number of characters between the letters A and Y

What is Accessibility
    - Accessibility is the practice of making a product that is usable by everyone, with or without disabilities
    - Accessibility is often confused with Usability but the main difference is that accessibility is focused more on people with disabilities
    - A product that's designed, developed, and tested with accessibility in mind will have more users than a product that is not accessible
    - There is more pressure on businesses to make applications accessible
    - Websites and mobile apps should be designed with accessibility in mind
    - Accessibility issues can cost loss of users, which in turn, loss of money to the business

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0
    - The World Wide Web Consortium has come up with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
        - This provides a list of guidelines and recommendations on how to make your website more accessible
    - Version 2.0, which was published on December 2008, contains a set of rules which were grouped under four categories - perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust
        - This is abbreviated to the acronym POUR
        - Perceivable
            - Perceivable means that the information should be presented to your users in different means
            - Some users may have sense difficulties eg visual impairment which makes them reliant on assistive technology eg Screen Readers
        - Operable
            - Operable refers to the principle that your users must be able to operate your website by using different means
            - Some users may have motor skills difficulties which means that they may struggle using a mouse and will need to use a keyboard
        - Understandable
            - Understandable means making sure that users can understand the information presented to them when using your website
            - Clear instructions should be provided as well as clear error messages to allow for understanding and fixing mistakes 
        - Robust
            - Robust refers to making sure that your website must be used by your users when they use third-party assistive technologies, even if the technology advances
            - This can be done by enforcing and adhering to standards eg HTML structure
    - In June 2018, version 2.1 was published to cover mobile accessibility, people with low vision and cognitive and learning abilities
        - It's an extension to version 2.0, so other things guidelines from 2.0 will also apply in 2.1
        - With this version there is a need for a website to be accessible in both portrait and landscape mode
        - If for instance there are animations present on a site they should be able to be turned off
        - There is also a need for being able to zoom or enlarge text for people with visual issues

WCAG 2.1 Conformance Levels
    - Within the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, each of the guidelines under 2.0 and 2.1 have a success criteria
    - This is defined through the three conformance levels that businesses or companies should conform to
        - Level A is the most basic conformance and through each level A, you must achieve 25 criteria from the accessibility guidelines
        - Level AA is mid range and through each level AA, apart from achieving 25 criteria from level A, you also need to achieve 13 new criteria on this level
        - Level AAA is the final and highest level meaning that you need to achieve the previous two levels, as well as another 23 criteria on top
    - As a starting point, it's a great start to make your website conform to level A, and then work your way through level AA to include more users
        - It is not manditory to reach AAA as this is targeted to specialist Websites
        - The recommended level is level AA, and this is the level that most teams are aiming to meet

Why Accessibility Testing is Important
    - Accessibility testing is the right thing to do
        - This is true of both individuals and society
        - Empathy will allow for better understanding of issues faced by people and will lead to improved products
    - Better accessibility means better user experience
        - Poor accessibility will usually lead to poor User Experience (UX) for some users
        - Oftentimes, accessibility testing is often seen as an afterthought, only after a product has been deployed to production
        - Good functionality does not mean good accessibility
    - Better accessibility also means that you widen your reach to other audiences
        - Try to have products that reach people with disabilities this benefits both customers and businesses
        - he law on accessibility differs from one country to another, so it’s best to check the regulations in a country first

 How can automated accessibility tests help us
    - Automating some tests makes sense given the amount of different accessibility checks that we need to do
        - By automating some of the accessibility tests basic accessibility issues can be caught earlier on in the development process
        - This can also serve as a living documentation to your team
    - Another benefit is it will prevent any regression issues related to accessibility from being deployed to production
        - By having automated tests in place it prevents fixed issues being redeployed to production
    - Automating tests frees up your time to do more complex testing activities
        - Automated accessibility tests will only catch a subset of the accessibility issues  that can occur
        - It is still beneficial to have them because it will help us speed up our testing process and they are cheap to run
    - Having automated accessibility tests provides a fast feedback loop to your design and development team
        - This is especially true if the tests are running as part of your continuous integration pipeline
        - The development team will know in an instant if the feature that they are working on has broken any accessibility rules

The importance of doing accessibility testing with actual users
    - Nothing beats actual accessibility testing with real users
    - Automating tests is good but there’s still a lot of benefit to gain if you invite real users with disabilities to test your website
    - The reason being is that they probably use different third party assistive technologies
        - This way there is first hand understanding on how a product is used day to day 
    - It may be a good idea to get them involved when your team is designing and developing a new feature
    - Doing accessibility testing with real users as well as doing an evaluation checklist
        - This can be achieved with having automated accessibility tests and checking it
        - It the best approach to ensuring that a site or app is accessible to users with different disabilities
    - Diving into accessibility testing can be challenging

Web Accessibility Test checks
    - Doing accessibility testing can be overwhelming, especially if it has not been done before
    - There are a lot of guidelines available to help get started
    - World Wide Web Consortium or W3C has created the web accessibility initiative which contains resources to help make a website or app more accessible
        - https://www.w3.org/WAI/
        - They provide Easy Checks to help get started
        - https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/

Checks That Can Be Automated
    - There are different accessibility rules that can be covered by an automated tool
    - Detecting if a page doesn't have a page title
        - Page title is important because this is the first thing that the screen reader says when a user visits your page
        - Without a page title can cause confusion with multiple tabs open
    - Another check that can be automated is image text alternatives
        - An automated accessibility testing tool can check if images have the alt text attribute
        - Users with visual impairments rely on alt texts to help them understand images that they may not be able to see
    - More checks that can be automated are ensuring correct heading structure and if there are any missing heading elements
        - It is a recommendation that a page have at least 1 heading
        - Having a good heading structure helps out on how your page will be accessed using keyboard only
    - A similar check to previous is checking colour contrast
        - An accessibility tool can help detect colour contrast issues and can report on these
        - This is very helpful for users with visual impairments who will have reading issues if there is not enough contrast between text and background
    - An automated tool can be used to detect errors in your HTML structure
        - This means checking for missing required elements or missing element attributes
    - An automated tool can also report issues related to missing ARIA labels that are required
        - The aria-label attribute is used as a label to elements where the label is not visible on the screen
        - This is particularly helpful for using screen readers
