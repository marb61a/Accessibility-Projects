Intro to Web Accessibility
    - Accessibility is often abbreviated to A11y, or Ally
    - The 11 in the middle represents the number of characters between the letters A and Y

What is Accessibility
    - Accessibility is the practice of making a product that is usable by everyone, with or without disabilities
    - Accessibility is often confused with Usability but the main difference is that accessibility is focused more on people with disabilities
    - A product that's designed, developed, and tested with accessibility in mind will have more users than a product that is not accessible
    - There is more pressure on businesses to make applications accessible
    - Websites and mobile apps should be designed with accessibility in mind
    - Accessibility issues can cost loss of users, which in turn, loss of money to the business

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0
    - The World Wide Web Consortium has come up with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
        - This provides a list of guidelines and recommendations on how to make your website more accessible
    - Version 2.0, which was published on December 2008, contains a set of rules which were grouped under four categories - perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust
        - This is abbreviated to the acronym POUR
        - Perceivable
            - Perceivable means that the information should be presented to your users in different means
            - Some users may have sense difficulties eg visual impairment which makes them reliant on assistive technology eg Screen Readers
        - Operable
            - Operable refers to the principle that your users must be able to operate your website by using different means
            - Some users may have motor skills difficulties which means that they may struggle using a mouse and will need to use a keyboard
        - Understandable
            - Understandable means making sure that users can understand the information presented to them when using your website
            - Clear instructions should be provided as well as clear error messages to allow for understanding and fixing mistakes 
        - Robust
            - Robust refers to making sure that your website must be used by your users when they use third-party assistive technologies, even if the technology advances
            - This can be done by enforcing and adhering to standards eg HTML structure
    - In June 2018, version 2.1 was published to cover mobile accessibility, people with low vision and cognitive and learning abilities
        - It's an extension to version 2.0, so other things guidelines from 2.0 will also apply in 2.1
        - With this version there is a need for a website to be accessible in both portrait and landscape mode
        - If for instance there are animations present on a site they should be able to be turned off
        - There is also a need for being able to zoom or enlarge text for people with visual issues

WCAG 2.1 Conformance Levels
    - Within the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, each of the guidelines under 2.0 and 2.1 have a success criteria
    - This is defined through the three conformance levels that businesses or companies should conform to
        - Level A is the most basic conformance and through each level A, you must achieve 25 criteria from the accessibility guidelines
        - Level AA is mid range and through each level AA, apart from achieving 25 criteria from level A, you also need to achieve 13 new criteria on this level
        - Level AAA is the final and highest level meaning that you need to achieve the previous two levels, as well as another 23 criteria on top
    - As a starting point, it's a great start to make your website conform to level A, and then work your way through level AA to include more users
        - It is not manditory to reach AAA as this is targeted to specialist Websites
        - The recommended level is level AA, and this is the level that most teams are aiming to meet
